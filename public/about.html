<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a beginner web developer currently at the starting stage of my journey, with a strong foundation in HTML. I enjoy creating simple, structured web pages and understanding how the web works at its core. Learning HTML has helped me appreciate the importance of clean structure, proper semantics, and user-friendly layouts.
</p>
<p>Although I am still early in my learning path, I am highly motivated and curious to expand my skills beyond HTML. I believe that every expert starts as a beginner, and I approach learning web development with patience, consistency, and enthusiasm. Each small project I work on strengthens my confidence and deepens my interest in building for the web.
</p>
<p>I am eager to explore new technologies such as CSS, JavaScript, and modern web tools as I grow. My goal is to continuously improve, learn from real-world practice, and eventually build interactive and responsive websites. This portfolio represents my first steps into web development and my commitment to learning more every day.
